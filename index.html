                    According to the same analysis, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would directly or indirectly raise pay for 41.5 million workers, or 29.2 percent of the wage-earning total. This raise would create an additional $144 billion in earnings, boosting the economy and potentially increasing the quality of living in areas such as New York.
                    Wage and cost of living struggles are not new, but they have become more prevalent over time. When adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage in the 1970s was around $2.00, which would be around $12.50 today. However, the cost of living has risen an immense amount, expanding the gap between income and basic expenses like housing, healthcare, and education. This gap is impacted by systemic variables such as legislative decisions, economic inequality, and social stratification, rather than just market pressures.

            For many, the goal of living in New York City is becoming a distant dream, as systemic challenges such as income stagnation and growing living costs create an almost unattainable barrier. We may, however, begin to rewrite New York City's economic narrative by tackling these concerns through a combination of progressive wage and housing policies. This will pave the path for a more fair and sustainable future, ensuring that the city continues to be a beacon of opportunity for individuals of all socioeconomic backgrounds.

                     The portion of a New York household’s budget spent on food, 12.8 percent, was not significantly different from 
                      the 12.6-percent U.S. average. New York-area households spent $6,639, or 62.4 percent, of their food dollars on
                       food at home and $4,004 (37.6 percent) on food away from home. Similarly, the average U.S. household spent 62.2
                        percent of its food budget on food at home and 37.8 percent on food away from home.

           <h2>MTA Fare Hikes: Reflection of New York City's Rising Living Costs</h2>
           <p>The escalating costs of the MTA fare in New York City serve as a striking example of inflation and its impact on the cost of living for residents. In a city where owning a car is prohibitively expensive, with monthly parking fees ranging from $199 to $500, and where a one-hour taxi or Uber ride can cost around $55 excluding tax and tips, public transportation emerges as the primary mode of commuting for most New Yorkers. This reliance on public transit makes the steady rise in MTA fares particularly significant.
        
            In 2000, a single subway or bus ride was priced at $1.50, but by 2023, this cost has nearly doubled to $2.90. Similarly, a 30-Day Unlimited ride card, which cost $63 in 2000, has seen its inflation-adjusted equivalent rise to $79 today. However, the actual price of this card has skyrocketed to $132, far outpacing the rate of inflation. This sharp increase in public transit costs highlights a broader trend of rising living expenses in New York City.
            
            For daily commuters, these fare hikes are not just numbers but a tangible increase in their daily expenses. A larger portion of their budget is now allocated to simply getting to work or school, squeezing their financial resources. The MTA's fare increases, therefore, are not just a matter of transportation costs but are emblematic of the broader challenges of escalating living expenses faced by New Yorkers. This situation underscores the growing financial burden on the city's residents, making the cost of living in New York City increasingly challenging.
